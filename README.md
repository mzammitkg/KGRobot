# KGRobot
KGRobot is KG's automated Telegram assisant.

The KGRobot project was started with the goal of providing KG with utility, fun, and an opportunity for non-developer employees to get their hands dirty with a simple coding project.

## Features
Here is a list of existing KGRobot modules and the functionality that they provide.

### Lunch
KGRobot is here to be helpful!  You can ask the bot what we will be having for Friday lunch this week.  If he knows, he will tell you!  Simply ask in natural English:

>Hey KGBot!  What's for lunch this week?

### Quotes
KGRobot has a great memory.  Unfortunately, he often remembers things that people have said and regret.  Fortunately, this can be very amusing for us!  You can ask KGRobot to give you a KGer quote, and if he has one he will display it for you to proudly read out loud! He will also give you another quote if one simple isn't enough!  Simple ask in natural English:

>KGBot, tell us a Ryan Egan quote!

>KGBot, give me a Zammit Zinger!

>KGRobot, give us a Juice-Gem!

>KGRobot, tell us another!

## Developer Guide
The KGRobot project was built from the ground up with extensibility in mind.  It is extremely easy to set up the project and build your own modules. Get creative!
